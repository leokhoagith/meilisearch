        title: Upgrade dependencies
        body: |
          This issue is about updating Meilisearch dependencies:
          - [ ] Cargo toml dependencies of Meilisearch; but also the main engine-team repositories that Meilisearch depends on (charabia, heed...)
          - [ ] If new Rust versions have been released, update the Rust version in the Clippy job of this [GitHub Action file](./.github/workflows/rust.yml)

          ⚠️ To avoid last minute bugs, this issue should only be done at the beginning of the sprint!

          The GitHub action dependencies are managed by [Dependabot](./.github/dependabot.yml)
